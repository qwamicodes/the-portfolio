  summary:
    "Having `passion` towards something that allows you to be a creator of things is very rare! and that superpower my friend is `software engineering`. It's been a very long journey from [high school](#education), so you and I can agree that I have been around for sometime ðŸ˜… and it has never been the same because I love what I do. I love using my *powers* to create *solutions* that can `scale` and are `efficient`. Recently started exploring the *entrepreneurship industry* and have started working on a some SaaS products, one with my close techies [Eben](https://ebenfrimpong.com) and **George** called [the-purple-box](https://thepurplebox.io) and the other [parnion](https://parnion.com), and education system for clarity of answers. I like to also pick up and learn new technologies and I have recently started picking up [Rust](https://rust-lang.com) for backend and distributed system applications. Been combining that with a bit of high level system designing",
